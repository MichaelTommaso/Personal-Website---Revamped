                    Hello, I am Michael Tommaso, a student at Regis High School, commmited to doing justice 
                    in my community. This website that I have designed is designated to spreading awareness to the 
                    difficulty and hypocrisy that an ex-convict experiences, while entering back into 
                    society. I hope that with this website, I will be able to highlight the most critical 
                    aspects of life that are hindered by stigmas surrounding ex-convcits. These walls hurt 
                    our entire community, and by spreading awareness, we can make ex-convicts no longer defined
                    by their past mistakes, but rather productive members of society looking towards the future.
